          Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), is a professional gunslinger who
          is out trying to earn a few dollars. Angel Eyes, The Bad (Lee Van
          Cleef), is a hitman who always commits to a task and sees it
          through--as long as he's paid to do so. And Tuco, The Ugly (Eli
          Wallach), is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco
          and Blondie share a partnership making money off of Tuco's bounty, but
          when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie.
          When Blondie and Tuco come across a horse carriage loaded with dead
          bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor, Bill Carson (Antonio
          Casale), that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a
          cemetery. Unfortunately, Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name
          of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now
          the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel
          Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and
          Blondie met with Carson and knows they know where the gold is; now he
          needs them to lead him to it. Now The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly must
          all battle it out to get their hands on $200,000.00 worth of gold.
